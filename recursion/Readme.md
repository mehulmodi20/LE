# Recursion
Breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller subproblems until you get to a small enough problem that it can be solved trivially. Usually recursion involves a function calling itself.

## The Three Laws of Recursion
1. A recursive algorithm must have a __base case__.
2. A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.
3. A recursive algorithm must call itself recursively.
