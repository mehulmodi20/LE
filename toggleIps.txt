Your first input is a list of connections. Each connection is a pair of devices, where each device is represented by its IPv4 address. Each distinct device (IP address) may be in one of two states: active or inactive. All devices begin inactive.

connections = [["192.167.0.0", "192.167.0.1"], ["192.167.0.2", "192.167.0.0"], ["192.167.0.0", "192.167.0.3"]]

Each connection can also be in one of two states: active or inactive. A connection is active only when both of its devices are active. Since all devices begin inactive, all connections also begin inactive.

Your second input is a sequence of single IP addresses that is used to toggle device states, and therefore also connection states, in order.

toggleIps = ["192.167.0.1", "192.167.0.0", "192.167.0.2", "192.167.0.0", "0.0.0.0"]

For each IP in toggleIps, toggle the state of any matching devices and connections. After each toggle, calculate the "impact count": the number of connections which the device participates in and have changed from active to inactive, or inactive to active.
Return an array, where each element contains the impact count after the corresponding toggle. This gives us a timeline of connection/disconnection impact throughout the simulation.

Example

For connections = [["192.167.0.0", "192.167.0.1"], 
                ["192.167.0.2", "192.167.0.0"], ["192.167.0.0", "192.167.0.3"]] and toggleIps = ["192.167.0.1", "192.167.0.0", "192.167.0.2", "192.167.0.0", "0.0.0.0"], the output should be
numberOfDevices(connections, toggleIps) = [0, 1, 1, 2, 0].

"192.167.0.1" would become active and is a part of connection: ["192.167.0.0", "192.167.0.1"]. However, since the other device is still inactive the connection remains inactive. The first count would be 0 because the connection has not changed state
When "192.167.0.0" becomes active there is already an active device connected to it - "192.167.0.1" which means there is now 1 active connection that was previously inactive
"192.167.0.2" becomes active which activates 1 connection between it and "192.167.0.0"
"192.167.0.0" becomes inactive, it exists in 2 connections, which were both active and now become inactive
"0.0.0.0" becomes active, but it has 0 connections
So overall for the sample inputs above:
numberOfDevices(connections, toggleIps) = [0, 1, 1, 2, 0]
